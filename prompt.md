SCRUM  AND  THE  AGILE  PROCEDURE'S  IMPACT  ON  SOFTWARE PROJECT MANAGEMENT
Abstract: The primary function of software project management is in the software sector. It encompasses several procedures and subject areas of knowledge. The project's requirements directly affect the software project's three  constraints,  which  are  time, cost,  and  scope.  An  agile  methodology is  an iterative  approach  to software development that enables rapid delivery, frequent modifies and risk redacting. In agile software projects  software  project management  is  equally fundamental.  Agile development  (Scrum) is  used by software companies and it benefits software project management.  Keywords: Software Project Management, Agile methodology and Scrum knowledge.

1. INTRODUCTION Software company ups and downs are prevalent in the modern day. People who have succeeded in the past are those who have learned from their mistakes. New approaches and  techniques  are  being  developed  due  to  technological  improvement.  With  the advancement of technology and processes the software sector has also adopted new strategies. The agile methodology is one of the techniques that contribute to the success of any software [1]. A  lack  of preparation and  the  absence  of  project  management  techniques  and  tools caused many software  projects  to fail  in the past often before they even reached the completion  stage.  The  success  of  software  is  always  a  result  of  effective  project management. The knowledge domains, tools, and strategies that are included in software project management. It comprises ten knowledge domains, of which six are supporting and four are core. Project cost management, [2] project scope management, and project cost  management  are core  knowledge areas.  Project human  resource  management, procurement management, communication management, stakeholder management, risk management, and project management are supporting knowledge areas. There are five processes involved in integration management, which unifies various knowledge domains initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and management. Agile  methodology  which is  adaptable enough  to  manage software  cost,  scope,  and quality, may accept changes in future needs. Scrum is the foundation for agile project management  because  it  emphasizes  ongoing  project  management  and  is  the  most extensively used agile project management technique. Since scrum is increasingly being used and [3] several software  projects  are  being  developed using scrum, we use the scrum  framework  to  examine  the  effects  of  agile  methodology  on  software  project management in the Pakistani software industry. Growing interest and scholarly need for empirical studies using agile principles in globally distributed projects. The adoption of agile development methodologies is widespread and has grown steadily over the past couple of decades  [4] producing software systems of excellent quality.  Agile methods manage these needs effectively and efficiently to manage them iteratively as they change and  evolve  toward  volatile  behavior.  Agile  methodologies  priorities  people  their communications with  one  another, operational software,  and  change  over processes, tools,  conventions,  and  goals.  The  requirement  [5]  combines  project  management methods for software development. Version control for maintenance change hunting is incorporated into the planning phase of the Scrum Software Maintenance Model. After planning the type  of maintenance request is given  particular consideration. Corrective maintenance is given priority and work has already begun on it by establishing a new code branch [6, 7].

2. BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE  There are  four  different approaches  to  software development  in  project  management have  been  discussed.  They include  the agile  approach, Extreme  Programming  (XP) approach, Kanban, and the Scrum methodology. The model is made up of 17 activities of agile or operations that are applied during the software development process (SDP) and are based on the most popular agile approaches. Although there are [8] variances between the many agile approaches, we have found a set of practices that are utilized by the majority of them. In literature we study that which included 11 activities that have been recognized,  the  chosen  practices  were  based.  Planning  Game,  Small  release, straightforward  design,  testing,  refactoring,  pair  programming,  group  ownership, continuous  integration,  forty-hour  workweek,  on-site  client,  and  From  an  Extreme Programming (XP) perspective of quality management coding standards refers to these procedures. Daily standups and retrospectives are  regarded as two of  the top 5 agile approaches in  accordance with the previous agile research. The following  procedures were applied based on the same investigation. The importance of teamwork in the agile methodology  is  reflected  in  the  small  cross-functional  teams,  which  we  refer  to  as multifunctional teams, which are used for monitoring progress. All planning that is done for  a  project  must  be  controlled,  and  this  is  why  monitoring  progress  is  taken  into consideration. The Self-Organizing Teams method was chosen as a study subject based on the same criterion.

2.1 Agile The  agile  method  of  project  execution  is  based  on  an  iterative  process  where requirements  and  solutions  develop as  a  result of  coordinated engagement  amongst stakeholders. By fostering independent and cross-functional teams, the methodology is successful.  Furthermore,  it  draws  on  the  necessity  of  change  and  ongoing  project fragmentation for improved quality and performance. The strategy emphasizes simplicity ongoing team [9] collaboration regular software delivery and having a highly motivated team with its 12 guiding principles. Agile ideals can be implemented by project managers through a variety of techniques [10]. 2.2 Software Development of Agile practices Being agile means being able to make and answer to change. It is a way of navigating a difficult  and  frightening  situation  and  eventually  succeeding  in  it.  There  are  other approaches besides only outlines like Scrum, Extreme Programming or Feature-Driven Development (FDD).  Agile  software expansion  is  a procedure  and software  progress encompasses  extra  than  just  Pair  programming,  test-driven  development,  stand-up meetings, and sprint  planning  sessions are examples of effective methodologies. The saying "agile software development" refers to a variety of frameworks and procedures that are  based  on the  ideals  and guiding principles  outlined  in  the  Strategy  for  Agile Software Development and its supporting 12 Philosophies [11]. 2.3 The 12 principles of agile methodology  On-time and efficient software delivery with consistency is our  primary goal is to please the client.  Take adjusting even at the very end of the improvement process. Agile approaches manage revolution to preserve the competitive edge of the client.  Bring working software frequently, ideally within a few weeks as opposed to a few months.  The  plan  requires  daily  collaboration  between  business  professionals  and developers.  Build initiatives around people that are motivated. Trust them to do the assignment, and give them the environment and support they need.  Direct  discussion  is  the  furthermost  effective  then  well-organized  means  to communicate with and within a progress crew [12].  The primary indicator of progress is functional software.  Agile practices  support  maintainable growth. The  supporters, programmers, and consumers  presumably  are  intelligent  on  the  way  to  maintain  the  current  pace indefinitely.  Nimbleness  is  improved  when  technological  perfection  and  good  design  are continuously prioritized.  The aptitude to exploit the quantity of work not done through straightforwardness is crucial.  Self-start up teams produce the greatest constructions, conditions, and designs.  The team tweaks also modifies his behavior through its considerations on how to be more active at regular intervals.  2.4  Extreme Programming (XP) User  stories  derived  from  customer  requirements must  be  used  when developing  in extremes [13, 14]. Developers create user stories on cards during project execution to specify  the  functional  needs  of  the  system.  Additionally,  the  approach  supports techniques  like  test-driven  progress  which  calls for  developers to  have  preconceived notions  around  a product  beforehand  ever  writing any  code.  The  project's beginning framework thus increases adaptability and emphasizes the significance of self-organizing squads  that  operate  at  a  maintainable  speed.  Agile  frameworks  gained  widespread acceptance  within  the  software  industry  because  to  their  emphasis on  fast software delivery,  product  quality,  and  customer  happiness  for  the  completion.  There  are numerous agile frameworks available for selection depending on the requirements and demands of various software projects. Out of these [15] paradigms, Scrum and Extreme Programming  are  the  most  well-known  and  widely  used  frameworks.  This  study contributes  by  carefully  examining  these  two  frameworks.  In  order  to  identify  their parallels,  differences,  and  characteristics  that  complement  one  another,  this  paper compares Scrum and Extreme programming in great detail. 2.5 feature Driven Development (FDD) The task of migration is seen as vital, particularly when dealing with distributed projects. One such example that involves massive volumes of data and transactions is the banking sector,  which  involves  sensitive  business  procedures.  Since  the  history  of  human transactions dates back to the beginning of banking, technical change is required to keep up.  Using  the most  recent  developments  to  give  consumers better  service.  A single project  management  strategy  may  not  be  strategically  effective  for  such  a  work, particularly in terms of upholding schedule and quality. For instance, two well-known and well-liked project management techniques, SCRUM and  Feature  Driven  Development (FDD), each have advantages and drawbacks. Due to SCRUM's emphasis on deadlines,quality can  frequently  suffer  [16]  whereas FDD's  emphasis on  quality might  result in project delays. For  the first  time,  SCR-FDD, a deliberate fusion  of  SCRUM  and FDD techniques, is suggested in this study. The suggested SCR-FDD is compared to SCRUM and FDD in a real-world project, and the findings reveal that it is 10% more effective in terms of quality and customer satisfaction than SCRUM, which is its closest competitor. 2.6 Kanban Delivering clients with high-quality information technology projects is made possible by the simple methodology of Kanban. The approach [17] appears to be focused on ongoing enhancements  to  software  and  secondary  infrastructure.  The  Kanban  process  also suggests breaking down complex team operations into smaller parts to make validation easier. Through task prioritizing,  delivery timelines, and workflow, Kanban focuses on what  has  to  be  done  and  when.  With  Kanban, time  wastage is  eliminated because developers  don't  write  more  specifications  than  they  can  code  and  test  [18].  Using workflow visualization as a tool to quickly identify and fix problems. Additionally, Kanban restricts the quantity of work that is in progress to meet the speed of the slowest step. By doing so, adjustments will have less overall impact while improving teamwork.  3. SCRUM Scrum  masters  lead  a  small  team  whose  main  duty  is  to  remove  any  obstacles  to completing  work  in  Scrum  and  an  agile  project  management  style.  The  Scrum methodology  framework  allows  you  the  freedom  to  manage  the  both  software development and requirements. A module can be produced in incremental, manageable chunks thanks to this  iterative besides incremental foundation paradigm, which builds software through  established  procedures.  Scrum  was developed  in  order to  enhance different development and session of life compatibility between individual and structural pronouncements  define  a  culture  focusing  on  [19]  recital  aid  shareholder  value construction and enhance the produce-skill of the growth process. Scrum is an extremely flexible framework that may be applied to any project in any sector. It can be used for both little and big undertakings. Additionally, scrum offers a time box-based methodology for executing information technology projects successfully. The time that set limits on the number of features a project team may complete. The team starts by developing a product accumulation that prioritizes altogether the necessary features. Before starting work on a sprint  the  team  decides which  topographies to  comprehensive from  this list  during a preparation meeting. The sprint accumulation cannot be changed while being carried out. The  progress team,  stakeholders,  scrum  master,  managers, and  product  owner  are among the fundamental roles in the scrum. Additionally, the team meets every day for quick 15-minute scrums when members provide each other updates on the status of their respective tasks. In the scrum, queries like "What did you do yesterday?" and "What are you doing now?" 
3.1 Scrum appropriate Scrum works best when the cross-functional team is employed on a creation progress project and there is an important amount of work that can be divided into multiple 2–4 week iterations. 3.2 Values of Scrum There are five main values of Scrum  Commitment  Courage   Focus   Openness   Respect. 3.3 Commitment to Scrum Ndividual team  members  pledge to  work  toward  reaching team  objectives.  [20] Each artifact now corresponds to a Scrum commitment since the “2020” update to the Scrum Guide.  The  standards  by  which  a  Scrum  artifact  is  evaluated  are  called  Scrum commitments. Scrum commitments  increase transparency and sharpen  a  developer's focus as a project develops. 3.4 Courage of Scrum When it comes to Scrum courage means that teams should feel secure when they refuse requests for assistance embrace challenges or try new things. If maintaining the status quo hinders their ability to achieve they should have the guts to do so. Members of the team act morally and tackle difficult issues. [21] 3.5 Focus of Scrum The ability of the Scrum Team to maintain uninterrupted concentration on the objectives or tasks is referred to as their focus. Additionally, it shows that a Scrum Team works to finish any tasks or goals on which it embarks. When Scrum Teams are laser-focused they are tenacious in minimizing waste accomplishing the set goals in the shortest amount of time and finally improving their efficiency. Pay attention to the tasks assigned for the sprint as well as the team's objectives. 3.6 Openness of Scrum The team's stakeholders and members are transparent about all the work they do and the difficulties they face. And the purpose of the Scrum meeting is to solve the problems identification.
3.7 Respects for Scrum Each team member values the independence and competence of the others. The Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers, and stakeholders should  all  see  respect  from the Scrum  Team  members  and  stakeholders  for  one  another.  Scrum  Teams  must  be conscious of the fact that working together is what makes them most effective. 3.8 Principles of Scrum Scrum uses an incremental iterative methodology Scrum brings together crews of folks who  taken  as  a  complete  possess  altogether  the  information  and  skills  required completing the exertion also share before gaining further knowledge as required. Scrum merges four official events into one containing event, the Sprint, for review and adaption. There are three main principles of scrum as fellow below:  Transparency  Inspection  Adaptation 3.9 Transparency Everyone on the side needs to be conscious of the challenges the other team members are facing for  the  group  to  function  well. Teams  identify  organizational  problems that hinder their success, often problems that have been around for a while. Both people doing the work and those being served by it must be able to see the emergent process and the resulting product. The perceived state of Scrum's three formal artefacts serves as the foundation for key choices. Low transparency in the creation of an artefact may result in choices  that  reduce value  and raise  risk.  Enables Untruthful and  wasteful  inspection results from lack of transparency. 3.10  Inspection To provide the  team  with  a chance to  evaluate  how  the process is  running,  frequent inspection  points  were integrated  into  the framework.  These  checkpoints include  the Sprint Review  Meeting  and Daily  Scrum  meetings [22]. The  Scrum artefacts and  the advancement of the agreed-upon goals must be scrutinized carefully and frequently to spot any potential deviations or issues. Scrum provides a cadence through its five events to aid in inspection. Analysis facilitates adaptability. It is thought to be useless to inspect without adapting. The purpose of Scrum events is to inspire change.  3.11 Adaptation The team continually assesses how things are going and reviews any elements that don't seem to make sense. If a customer requests a change to the requirements scrum takes this into account and incorporates it in the following Sprint. Instances where a product inspection reveals only minor changes that need to be made are treated as feedback and incorporated into the following Sprint cycle. When an inspector finds that a few process variables  are  outside of  what  is considered  acceptable  the inspector  must notify  the company  [23].  It  remains  required  to  modify  the  procedure  being  used  before  the constituents existence produced  if any procedure variables decrease  outer of allowed limits or if the close produce is inappropriate. To cut extra deviation and modification needs toward be complete as soon as possible. When the persons involved lack self-management or authorization reworking becomes more stimulating. When a Scrum Crew discovers anything new through observation, it is expected to adjust [27-39].  4  SCRUM PROCESSES Scrum processes involve the product holder, the scrum team and scrum master. The shortest time frame a team can allocate work that will be finished in three to four weeks is called a sprint. The current sprint's requirements are all listed in the sprint backlog. Those that can change throughout development, determines the tasks for sprint. The software owner evaluates the product backlog, which is considered to contain the majority of the requirements. It is divided into sprints and after that, there is a sprint planning structure that describes different tactics for finishing a sprint on time. Each sprint aims to deliver a potentially organized and error-free product. A scrum master is present during the 15-minute meetings which can run longer. Software that is supplied in iterations and has the functionalities the customer wants might have the requirements changed at any time.  Using  the  scrum  approach  makes  handling the  change requirements  relatively simple.  Scrum  is  a  method  for controlling  the development  process  that  applies  the organizational  process  control  hypothesis's  notions  of  adaptability,  proficiency,  and litheness. Scrum focuses on teamwork and product quality in a flexible setting.
4.1 Scrum Master The Scrum Master remains the associate of the side tasked with ensuring that the team adheres to  the agile ideals and principles along with the measures and practices that were decided upon by the team. This is some consisting of Scrum Master:   Removing constraints   Creating a setting anywhere the team can work effectively   team changing aspects issues   Ensuring a positive working connection amongst the team and the product holder along with other people. Defending the group against disruptions and diversions from outside. Even by teams who do not formally use Scrum the title "Scrum Master" is frequently used to describe this position. Iteration manager, agile coach, and team coach are other uncommon terms. Organizations all over the world are adopting Scrum as a method for developing software. But  as  businesses  switch  from  conventional  plan-driven  development  to  agile development using Scrum, the question of which Scrum role Product Owner, [25] Scrum Master or Scrum Team Member relates to a project manager or, conversely, which Scrum role project managers should assume arises. The actions that make up the Scrum Master role have been discovered through our study, as  well  as  the additional  duties that  Scrum  Masters  really play  in the  real  world.  In particular, project supervisors play a  important role in  the  exertion  of scrum masters. These findings indicate that firms that use Scrum as a development methodology need to reevaluate the position of project managers. As some obligations of the latter role are more in line with the typical duties of a project manager, we predict that it could be better for project managers to transition into product owners. To get empirical data on the tasks Scrum Masters really carry out and the additional duties they assume, we first conducted a link to the Scrum Master position and then a case study. The job of the Scrum Master and the Project Manager are frequently merged in practice, and by integrating the findings from the literature with observations from medium-sized development organizations, we were able to identify tensions and conflicts between these roles. Managers take up the Product Owner job rather than the Scrum Master role. 4.2 Pros and Cons  Pros:   The role of a scrum master happening a side gives a self-organizing side continual access toward a person who must rummage-sale agile and Scrum in specific in another context and can comfort the team choose how to use it in their scenario.  To  free  up  the  recreation  of  the  side  to  distillate  on  forming  output  that  will consequence in the intended goal, the scrum master is someone who can deal with interruptions, disturbances and barriers [26]. Cons:  It  is  simple  to  transition  project  managers  who  are  accustomed  to  top-down management styles hooked on a scrum master part and count on them to perform well.  Asking someone to take on the role of scrum master without any prior knowledge of working in an agile environment.  Imagining the assignment of a scrum master to remain the similar across all teams regardless of how long the team has been working together, how well they grasp agile ideals and principles, or how much domain experience they have.  An  established  team  will probably  require  considerably  less  mentoring from  a scrum master than one that is still getting to know one another and implementing agile values and its principles of scrum.  5  MANAGEMENTS OF PROJECT 5.1 Scope Management of Project The most challenging and crucial responsibility is managing the project scope because requirements  are  constantly  changing and  sometimes those  changes  also  affect the project's scope. Once a project has begun a written contract between the client and the software company is established requiring both parties to fulfill and respect one another [16]. Changes will occur in every project from the beginning to the finish and scrum offers a  simple  way  to  deal  with  them.  The  developer  implements  these  needs  after  the requirement team analyses and determines their scope and relevance following the team lead's instructions. This remains the movement of one sprint and if somewhat changes are made we can quickly execute them by getting Change Control Board (CCB) approval. 5.2 Time and Cost Management of Project The time and cost of a project are the next major challenge after determining the scope and then most IT projects have a bad way record of the cost it is particularly challenging to manage both at once. Projects may also have gone over budget or schedule. Because that work is broken down into close chunks and sprints are established developers may build their chunks on schedule and within budget utilizing agile methodologies which very gracefully addresses this issue. Because of this organizational growth and productivity are exceptionally high and economical. 5.3 Quality Management of Project When a project quality or product has the entire features quality product. Quality project is clear as the requirement that a project is delivered on time within budget and with full coverage of its intended scope quality has a significant impression on Software Project Management  (SPM).  Because agile techniques  place a high  priority  on  creating fine excellence  products  they  offer  the  top  practices  that  container  remain  monitored  to produce superior results. SCRUM offers the best ways aimed at saving time and if quality its  concentration  is  on  "Easy  to  use"  then  conformance  towards  supplies.  All  agile methods  are effective  in terms  [16]  of  quality  issues. Scrum  masters  set  the quality standards for  all  software  sectors and they  must  guarantee that any underdeveloped projects or products are simple to use delivered on schedule and adhere to the project's scope. 
5.4 Risk Management of Project Most  often,  people  are  the  project's  assistants  in  organizations.  Depending  on  the People's  level  of  knowledge  and  competence  in  the  subject.  Because  of  this,  agile techniques place a strong  importance  on  team  supervision and team development. A large team makes sure  of  not  guarantee a successful product or satisfied customers, however. There are two competing hypotheses. While some organizations do not place a high priority on teamwork, the majority claims that SCRUM allows them to hire only individuals who are motivated by goals and able to work well in  a group. Additionally, SCRUM  emphasizes  teamwork  and  collaboration  amongst  members.  When  using SCRUM  as  their  project  management  (PM)  methodology  an  organization's  HR management  had  a  significant  impact  on  project  management  because  tasks  are distributed among the team and SCRUM methodologies mandate that team members assist one another after finishing separate duties.  6  CONCLUSION  The  knowledge  domains of  software  project  management  are positively  impacted  by scrum  it  has  been  determined.  Scrum  requires  a favorable  impact  taking  place  the project's time, budget, scope, quality, risk, and cost. Scrum has a significant impact on Human Resource HR  management  as  well because some organizations prioritize the goal of hiring while others do not. Scrum helps to decrease risk, control costs, and deliver high-quality  products  promptly.  The  application  scrum  rules  in  Software  Project Management (SPM) is made possible by the agile style in the direction of agile project implementation which gives scheme managers in the software manufacturing a practical method for handling uncertainty.
